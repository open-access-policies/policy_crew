# AI Developer Instructions: CrewAI Policy Generation Framework

## 1. Project Vision & Goal

**Your Persona:** You are an AI Software Developer. Your task is to implement a multi-agent system using the **CrewAI framework** to automate the creation of an Information Security Management System (ISMS).

**Core Objective:** The system will take a structured JSON file (containing an organization's requirements) as input and produce a complete, tailored set of draft policies and procedures in Markdown format as its final output.

## 2. System Architecture Overview

You will build a hierarchical crew consisting of one manager agent (the Conductor) and two subordinate agents (the Architect and the Writer). The Conductor will orchestrate the entire workflow, breaking down the high-level goal into sequential tasks and delegating them to the appropriate specialist agent.

- **Input:** A single JSON file from the "ISMS Requirements Interviewer" agent, located at `output/interview_results.json`.
    
- **Output:** A collection of Markdown files representing the ISMS policy and procedure set, saved to an output folder.
    

## 3. Agent Definitions

Below are the high-level definitions for each agent in the crew. You will use these parameters to define each agent within your CrewAI application. Since quality and reasoning are the top priorities for this task, more powerful models are recommended.

### Agent 1: The Conductor (Manager Agent)

You will define this agent in CrewAI using the following parameters:

- **role:** `ISMS Project Conductor`
    
- **goal:** `To manage the entire policy creation process from start to finish, ensuring the final output is coherent, complete, and directly addresses the requirements outlined in the input JSON.`
    
- **backstory:** `You are a Senior GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) Manager at a rapidly growing tech firm. With over a decade of experience, you have managed large teams of analysts and are deeply familiar with the delicate balancing act between establishing robust governance and enabling a fast-moving, innovative business. You are meticulous and pragmatic, knowing that a poorly written or ill-conceived policy can do more harm than good, damaging both the company's operational efficiency and its reputation. Your colleagues respect you for your high standards and your ability to drive complex, multi-stakeholder projects to completion through intelligent delegation and team coordination. Your core belief is that quality is not an accident; it is the result of intelligent direction, strategic delegation, and relentless iteration. You excel at knowing which specialist to delegate to for each task and managing complex workflows through natural team leadership.`
    
- **llm:** Use the recommended Ollama model: `mixtral:8x7b-instruct`. This model has excellent reasoning and planning capabilities, which are essential for a manager agent.
    
- **memory:** `True`. The Conductor's memory is critical for managing the multi-step workflow, remembering the architect's blueprint to properly delegate tasks to the writer.
    

### Agent 2: The Policy Architect (Subordinate Agent)

You will define this agent in CrewAI using the following parameters:

- **role:** `Information Security Policy Architect`
    
- **goal:** `To take the initial JSON requirements brief and create a structured plan, or "Table of Contents," for the entire ISMS. This plan will dictate which policies and procedures need to be written and what key sections each should contain.`
    
- **backstory:** `You are a senior security architect with deep expertise in various compliance frameworks (HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.). Your strength is in structuring and planning. You can look at a company's profile and immediately create a logical, high-level blueprint for their entire security program.`
    
- **llm:** Use the recommended Ollama model: `llama3.1:8b-instruct`. This model offers a great balance of strong reasoning for structuring content while being efficient.
    
- **memory:** `True`. Memory enables the Architect to handle iterative feedback or clarifications from the Conductor, ensuring consistency.
    

### Agent 3: The Policy Writer (Subordinate Agent)

You will define this agent in CrewAI using the following parameters:

- **role:** `Technical Policy Writer`
    
- **goal:** `To write the full set of policies and procedures based on the architect's blueprint and the organization's requirements. The final output must be a collection of well-written, comprehensive Markdown files saved to a designated output folder.`
    
- **backstory:** `You are a skilled technical writer who specializes in information security. You excel at taking a structured outline and a set of requirements and fleshing them out into clear, comprehensive, and professional prose. You are the workhorse of the team, responsible for producing the detailed content.`
    
- **llm:** Use the recommended Ollama model: `llama3.1:70b-instruct`. As the primary content generator where quality is paramount, using a large, high-quality model is crucial for producing nuanced and well-written policies.
    
- **memory:** `True`. Memory helps the Writer maintain a consistent tone, style, and terminology across multiple, related documents, making the final ISMS feel cohesive.
    

## 4. Workflow & Task Delegation

The Conductor agent must manage the following workflow. You will create `Task` objects in CrewAI where the `description` for each task is read from an external file.

1. **Initial Analysis:** The Conductor receives the main goal ("Generate a complete ISMS policy set"). The Conductor's own instructions for how to manage the project should be read from `docs/conductor/instructions.md`.
    
2. **Task 1: Create the Blueprint (Delegation to Architect):**
    
    - The Conductor will create a task for the **Policy Architect**.
        
    - The task's `description` must be loaded from the file `docs/architect/instructions.md`.
        
    - This task must be provided with the file `output/interview_results.json` as context.
        
    - The Architect's task is to return a structured list of all the policy and procedure documents that need to be created, along with a high-level outline for each.
        
3. **Task 2: Write All Documents (Delegation to Writer):**
    
    - The Conductor will create a single, comprehensive task for the **Policy Writer**.
        
    - The task's `description` must be loaded from the file `docs/writer/instructions.md`.
        
    - This task must be provided with the following files as context:
        
        1. The **full blueprint** from the Architect.
            
        2. The original interview results file: `output/interview_results.json`.
            
        3. The policy template: `docs/templates/policy_template.md`.
            
        4. The procedure template: `docs/templates/procedure_template.md`.
            
    - The writer's responsibility is to generate all the specified policies and procedures, tailoring them with the company's details, and write each one to a separate Markdown file in a designated output folder.
        
4. **Final Verification:** The Conductor's final step is to confirm that the Policy Writer has completed its task and that the output files have been created.
